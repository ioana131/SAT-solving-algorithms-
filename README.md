1. Open the Python file
2. Press Run
3. When promped in the console, write the algorithm you want to test (dpll, dp, resolution), then press on enter. After this, enter a number from 1 to 5 to select which input file you want to run.(example1.cnf, example2.cnf, example3.cnf, example4.cnf, example5.cnf)
